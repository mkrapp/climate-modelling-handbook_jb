# Welcome to the ASP Modelling Hub Winter School

This is a handbook for a 2-day, hands-on climate modelling workshop.
In the first part, we are exploring a climate model (WRF), visualizing its outputs, and running your simulations, while quipping you with some basic troubleshooting skills.
In the second part, we are diving into analysis and visualization tools tailored for climate data, enabling you to derive meaningful insights from vast datasets.
